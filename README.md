I needed a door my son could not break on the v0.2 the stock vhb style doors did not suffice, having WhoppingPochard's Clicky-Clack doors on my 2.4 and Trident I decided to create this version (mini version) for my son.

# Serious special thanks to WhoppingPochard for creating the original mod in the first place.

----------------------------------

Printed Parts lists, well, just about everything we have is found in the (CAD and stl) folder above, I included fusion360 files and .step files along with the .stl's for anybody eager to create their own thing.

Hartk's v0.2 stealth skirts were re-worked to allow clearances for the mini-fridge door (found in the CAD and STL folder)
