# MiniFridge
## Fridge Door for v0's

This project was designed from WhoppingPochard's Clicky-Clack door mod for 2.4's and Tridents. 

HUGE SHOUT OUT TO HIM for his design and giving me the idea to make a door for the v0's

WHY? Because it's the Bees Knees! Seriously though, Top hat issues aside it makes sense to have 1 tall door NOT to mention the "fridge" handle on the v0 literally looks like a mini fridge.

# **CURRENT RELEASE: BETA TESTING! RevA**

## **Issues:**

Different dimensional profiles of 1515 extrusions.

I have an LDO v0.2 and honestly, the rails are nice having 3.2mm T slot gap, however, others available are between 6.2-6.5mm slot profile.

![1515 EXTRUSION COMPARISON](https://github.com/TheVoronModder/MiniFridge/assets/142328467/916d1936-d7f8-4788-9f6a-3e74f0258650)

In the Above image the LDO extrusions Profile A. and B. (LEFT) are different than regular extrusion A. and B. (RIGHT)

## **SOLUTION!**

The solution is simple, have different profiles of hinges and latches for various Extrusion T Slot profiles.
