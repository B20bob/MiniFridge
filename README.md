# MiniFridge
## Fridge Door for v0's

This project was designed from WhoppingPochard's Clicky-Clack door mod for 2.4's and Tridents. 

HUGE SHOUT OUT TO HIM for his design and giving me the idea to make a door for the v0's

WHY? Because it's the Bees Knees! Seriously though, Top hat issues aside it makes sense to have 1 tall door NOT to mention the "fridge" handle on the v0 literally looks like a mini fridge.

# **CURRENT RELEASE: BETA TESTING! RevA**

## **Issues:**

Different dimensional profiles of 1515 extrusions.

I have an LDO v0.2 and honestly, the rails are nice having 3.2mm T slot gap, however, others available are between 6.2-6.5mm slot profile.

In the Above image the LDO extrusions Profile A. and B. (LEFT) are different than regular extrusion A. and B. (RIGHT)

## **SOLUTION!**

The solution is simple, have different profiles of hinges and latches for various Extrusion T Slot profiles. 



BOM:
4x m5 x 40 Pin
12x m6 x 3 Neodymium magnets
2x m3 x 6 SCHC bolts

Extrusions are dependent on V0 mods you have. 

For OEM LDO Voron v0.2 
2x 350mm Long MiSUMi LDO 1515 extrusions 
2x 200mm Long MiSUMi LDO 1515 extrusions

Top Hats for LDO are shorter than generic Voron V0.2 kits.

# This mod has 2 versions, 1. Keep TOP HAT open functionality and 2. Eliminate Top Hat Movement

I personally prefer option 2 eliminating the need of a bending tophat.

**Due to variances in different 3d printers dimensional accuracy in printing results may vary, the v0.2 has the XY gantry parts in the middle of the extrusions, there are configurations/mods that replace the plastic parts as part of the frame together leading to a more stable V0.2 anyway.***
