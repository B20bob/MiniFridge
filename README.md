## Outlined below

**Due to variances in different 3d printers' dimensional accuracy, v0.2 heights may vary, the v0.2 has the XY gantry parts in the middle of the extrusions, there are configurations/mods that replace the plastic parts as part of the frame together leading to a more stable V0.2 anyway.***
