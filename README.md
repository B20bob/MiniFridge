## Fridge Door for v0's



${{\color{Goldenrod}\Huge{\textsf{  Door\ Lock\ latch\ is\ being\ worked\ on\ at\ the\ moment\ \}}}}\$


This project was designed from WhoppingPochard's Clicky-Clack door mod for 2.4's and Tridents. 

### Huge Shout Out to woppingpochard for his design which gave me the idea to make a door for the v0's

# **CURRENT RELEASE: BETA TESTING! RevA**

## **Issues:**

Different dimensional profiles of 1515 extrusions.

LDO rails are specific compared to other rails such as MakerBeam XL and V Slot Channels

In the above image, the LDO extrusions Profile A. and B. (LEFT) are slightly different than the MakerBeam XL (CENTER) and amazon.com sourced 1515 extrusions, most we have found are V Slot style and could potentially work, however, LDO and MakerBeam XL are currently ONLY supported.

## **SOLUTION!**

The solution is simple, have different profiles of hinges and latches for various Extrusion T Slot profiles. 



BOM:
4x m5 x 40 Pin
12x m6 x 3 Neodymium magnets
2x m3 x 6 SCHC bolts

Extrusions are dependent on V0 mods you have. 

For OEM LDO Voron v0.2 
2x 350mm Long MiSUMi LDO 1515 extrusions 
2x 200mm Long MiSUMi LDO 1515 extrusions

Top Hats for LDO are shorter than generic Voron V0.2 kits.

# This mod has 4 versions....

## Outlined below

**Due to variances in different 3d printers' dimensional accuracy, v0.2 heights may vary, the v0.2 has the XY gantry parts in the middle of the extrusions, there are configurations/mods that replace the plastic parts as part of the frame together leading to a more stable V0.2 anyway.***
