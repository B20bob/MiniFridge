I needed a better door for my v0.2 the flip up lid isn’t necessary to me so I created the “Mini Fridge Version 1” Then I realized I could shrink WhoppingPochard’s Clicky-Clack Door and re-fit it for the v0’s 3mm slot extrusions.

# Special thanks to whoppingpochard for creating the original mod for the 2.4 and Trident found here:

The printed parts list is for 2 variations we have encountered during the testing phase. 
1.	Stock Panels (No Foam)
2.	Panels with 3mm Foam
During the testing phase Fizzy Tech Discord Server Admin Robert found out he could use TOPHAT extrusion kit to have the 200mm X bars with threads ready to go along with the LDO Micron 3D Printer Frame Kit Extrusions kit for the Z Bars that were needed to enclose the panels in.

ISSUES:
1.	if your running any screen other than the stock one you need to either print Fizzy Tech Discord Server Admin Jose’s skirt extenders for HartK’s Stealthchop mod with Waveshare 2.8” screen found here: https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/Voron%20Mods/Voron%200/0.2/2_8WaveshareDisplay/Stealth/STLs/Stealth

# This mod has 4 versions....

## Outlined below

**Due to variances in different 3d printers' dimensional accuracy, v0.2 heights may vary, the v0.2 has the XY gantry parts in the middle of the extrusions, there are configurations/mods that replace the plastic parts as part of the frame together leading to a more stable V0.2 anyway.***
